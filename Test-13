1)) What is a RESTfulAPI?	

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a web service that follows the principles of REST architecture.
It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources identified by URLs. 
RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request, and they often use JSON or XML for data representation
. This architecture is known for its simplicity, scalability, and flexibility.


2))WRITE A PROGRAM THAT PROMPTS THE USER TO ENTER TWO INTEGERS AND THEN DIVIDES THE FIRST INTEGER BY THE SECOND. USE A TRY-CATCH BLOCK TO HANDLE ANY POTENTIAL DIVISION BY ZERO ERRORS.
